### Pre-Commit
Pre-Commit applies a git hook to the local repository such that linting is checked and applied on every `git commit` action. Install from the root of the repository using:

```bash
source env/activate
pre-commit install
```

If you have already committed before installing the pre-commit hooks, you can run on all files to "catch up":

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
